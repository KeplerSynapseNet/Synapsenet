CREATOR RULES (IMMUTABLE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The creator's rules and the project's meaning/purpose are immutable. No one has the right to change them.
- These interface documents define the core rules and logic of SynapseNet; the core rules/logic must not be altered.
- You may improve implementation, fix bugs, add features, expand documentation, and optimize performance as long as you do not change core behavior or bypass prohibitions/safeguards.
- Any fork or modification that changes core behavior, removes safeguards, or bypasses prohibitions is not an official SynapseNet project.
- NGT earned by such a fork is not recognized or associated with SynapseNet.
- Wallets tied to such violations are subject to automatic burn by community decision.
