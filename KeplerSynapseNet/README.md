## Project Description

SynapseNet is a decentralized peer-to-peer network for collective intelligence. It is to KNOWLEDGE what Bitcoin is to MONEY. A decentralized AI network where you mine with intelligence using Proof of Emergence.

This idea sprung from everyday habits—exploring knowledge networks, tinkering with Tor, and chatting with local AIs. Seeing how closed today’s AI stacks feel, Kepler asked: why not let people feed useful knowledge into an open network, let every AI draw from it, and reward the contributors? That’s mining intelligence.

"Intelligence belongs to everyone"
